# ðŸ“ˆ Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting Project

This project is a complete end-to-end pipeline for **scraping**, **cleaning**, **analyzing**, and **predicting** cryptocurrency prices using historical data from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/). It supports advanced modeling using multiple machine learning algorithms including ARIMA, Random Forest, SVR, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust system for:

- Scraping historical cryptocurrency data (from 2014 to today)
- Cleaning and imputing missing data using advanced techniques (e.g., KNNImputer)
- Conducting data analysis and visualization
- Modeling cryptocurrency prices using time series and machine learning models
- Forecasting future prices for any selected cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC, ETH)
- Visualizing forecasted trends for the next 60 days
